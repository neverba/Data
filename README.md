**Correction Statement for the Paper**

I find that my paper contains some formatting errors. These errors do not affect the scientific conclusions of the paper, but to ensure the accuracy and professionalism of the paper, I feel it is necessary to make corrections.

The corrections are as follows:

(1): In the NOMENCLATURE on the first page, "t,m" should be "tm".

(2): In the NOMENCLATURE on page one, the term "Indices of electrical, heat, and gas nodes in UIEs" should be corrected to "Indices of electrical, heat, and gas nodes in UIES."

(3): In equation (1a), $P_{k, t}^{\mathrm{tu}}$ and $P_{k, t}^{\mathrm{ut}}$ respectively represent the power on both sides of the connecting line between TS and UIES_k.
     In equation (1b), $P_{ku,k,t}^{\mathrm{uu}}$ and $P_{ku,u,t}^{\mathrm{uu}}$ respectively represent the power on both sides of the connecting line between UIES_k and UIES_u.

(4): In equation (2), "k=1" should be corrected to "r=1".

(5): In equation (36), the dual residual “ε” should not have the subscript k. 


I deeply apologize for any inconvenience these errors may have caused to you.
